# HTTP-SERVER

This includes all files necessary for running the http server as well as the files for the artificial horizon and heading indicators.

The basis for the flight indicators came from the repository:
https://github.com/sebmatton/jQuery-Flight-Indicators  
(note: the svg files had to be converted to png format to work properly with our setup)
